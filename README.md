# Design
![](screenshots/colours.png)
for my design phase i used colorhunt.io to find a few different colour schemes while i was using the colours through my project i found the reds pinks and oranges extremely different to use without over powering the entire screen so i opted for a more cleanier and less agressive tone using black white and bright light blue.

Before i started coding my css and html i used wireframing from balsamiq to give me an idea of how i want to code and style my project. I already had the idea to build a rather simple site as i prefer being able to quickly view information rather than having lots of flashy lights

For my Index page i chose to make a centered up page with links around the main header

for my fonts i looked at a few different ones i wanted a something abit sharp and that could fit into an industial look to fit the black and white theme
Square Sans Serif, 
Roboto, 
Arial, 
crimson text semi bold, 
nunito semibold, 
exo 2, 
Le harve, i ended up chosing Exo 2 as it was also a google font it was very easy to implement


# code

   ![](screenshots/topnavcode.png)
   For my html i place everything inside of a main container and expanded out from there i kept a similar layout as seen in my wireframes for all the pages apart from my main index page
   using "mainbox" i set my height and width slightly smaller than the "containter as it allowed for me to see manipulate the sizing and functionality of the box later on in the design


   For my Navbar i wanted it to group together so i floated all the text right and using text-decoration to clean up the a tags used inside of the nav bar
   TopNav was used to represent the Top navigation bar used in most of the pages


![](screenshots/gridcodecss.png)

I kept a theme for all of my grid boxes in the classes i state the main user in this section of code project then after grid as this allowed to be able to refer back fast

project grid was used inside of my project.html page to split up the text and images to go side by side and were grouped together as text to image
